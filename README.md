# IoT_Lamotriz

Project applied in the Lamotriz laboratory, at the University Federal of Cear√°, with the objective to applied IoT in the embedded systems presents there. 

To achieve this objective, we choose to use MQTT protocol within a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32. The Raspberry Pi is the broker and the ESP32 are publishers and subscribers. To manage all that, we choose to build an interface using the node-red application, which will be hosted in the Raspberry.

So, we have :

- Mqtt:
    - Raspberry PI as Broker (Server Mqtt)
    - ESP32 as clients
    - Node-RED as interface (on Raspberry Pi)


# Setup the environment

To develop and test, we'll set a Linux environment to generate the mqtt broker and the node-red.

If you are using a Linux OS, you can follow this tutorial:

## 1. Install Node-RED

You can follow the tutorial in [Node-RED site](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local) or just follow the steps bellow.

0. Prerequisites

    To install Node-RED locally you will need a supported version of Node.js.

1. Installing with npm

    To install Node-RED you can use the npm command that comes with node.js:

```sh
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```

2. Running

    Once installed as a global module you can use the node-red command to start Node-RED in your terminal. You can use Ctrl-C or close the terminal window to stop Node-RED.

```
    $ node-red

To install the node from the command-line, you can use the following command from within your user data directory (by default, $HOME/.node-red):

```sh
    npm install node-red-contrib-aedes
```

### 1.2 ChartJs

You can follow the tutorial in [Node-RED page](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-chartjs) or the tutorial bellow.

To install the node from the command-line, you can use the following command from within your user data directory (by default, $HOME/.node-red):

```sh
    npm install node-red-contrib-chartjs --save
```
